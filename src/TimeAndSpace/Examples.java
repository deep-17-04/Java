/*
 * Time Complexity - Applying the asymptotic analysis to measure the time requirement of an algorithm as a function of input size is known as time complexity.
 * Total time complexity of a program is equal to the summation of all the running time of disconnected fragments.
 * Types - 1) Worst Case : Big O()
           2) Best Case : Big Omega
           3) Average Case : Big Theta
 * Space Complexity - Space Complexity is the extra memory space requirement of an algorithm by applying asymptotic analysis.
