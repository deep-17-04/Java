     * Why is Java not a pure object-oriented programming language?
     * The seven criteria to qualify as an oops language:
     * Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, All pre-defined are objects, All user defined types are objects, All operations through methods.
     *
     * 8 primitive data types are not objects and can be called without objects. (Wrapper class can't be used as it internally uses primitive types.)
     * Static variables and methods can be called without using objects.
