     * 1) We have compiled the code have byte code with us, using Java Compiler.
     * 2) Now JVM which is platform dependent, tries to convert the byte code in machine code and communicates with OS.
     * 3) JRE provides the runtime libraries like the in-built classes and util packages.
     * 4) JDK allows us to write new code and develop applications in Java.
     *
     * JIT compiler converts the byte code into the native machine code.
     * It improves the performance of the application
