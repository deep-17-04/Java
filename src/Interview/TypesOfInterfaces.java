     * Normal Interface - When we have two or more methods.
     * Functional (SAM) Single Abstract Method: When we have one method.
     * Marker: It has no methods and hence empty.
     *
     * We can create properties in interface, but we cannot modify as they are final.
     * The methods are by default public.
     *
     * We can extend one class and multiple interfaces.
     * Java does not support multiple inheritance directly, but indirectly using interfaces we can implement.
     *
     * Abstract Classes:
     * We can't create objects, the methods need can have body.
