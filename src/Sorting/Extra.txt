Stable Sort: A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order
             in sorted output as they appeared in the input unsorted array.

In Place Sort: An in-place algorithm is an algorithm which does not require an extra space and produces an output in the
               same memory that contains the original data by transforming the input ‘in-place’.
               However, we can use a small constant extra space for variables.
